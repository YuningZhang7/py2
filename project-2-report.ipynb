    "Over the past decade electricity consumption has drastically increased due to technological advancements and an increasing population. This increase highlights a need for change to move toward reducing environmental damage and significant costs. Our report aims to dive into a deeper analysis of the factors causing an electricity consumption increase in Scotland and to determine any connections with the housing types in postcodes."
