    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption plays a crucial role in shaping a countries economic activity, environmental impact and long term sustainability. In the past decade, Scotland has initiated a rapid transition toward more renewable energy sources and has ambitious national energy targets. With a growing shrae of electricty coming from wind, hydro and other low carbon sources, Scotland offers a unique landscape for understanding how consumption patterns are evolving in a modern energy system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examines electricity consumption in Scotland by exploring consumption trends over the past 10 years, regional differences and how accommodation types can alter the way electricty consumption has adjusted. By analysing these factors, the study aims to provide an insight into how Scotland's energy use is changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding energy consumption is essential not only for managing resources efficiently but also for planning a resilient and environmentally responsible energy future. For this reason, Scotland's experience provides valuable lessons for other regions pursuing cleaner energy transitions."

    "# **Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project comes from one main source, data on electricity consumption for postcodes in 2023. Using the same data source we found replicas of this dataset for the years 2015 to 2023.\n",
    "The datasets were loaded as CSV files using pandas. On initial investigation, it was found that the datasets contained all postcodes in the United Kingdom. The datasets were cleaned to remove English, Welsh and Northern Irish postcodes, leaving our datasets with Scottish postcodes solely.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also prepared another dataset to us in our project, this is the Scottish housing data categorised by Data Zone. We cleaned this data to only contain the total percentages of 3 accommodation types, these being: Whole house or bungalows, Flats or apartments and Caravans or other mobile homes.\n"
